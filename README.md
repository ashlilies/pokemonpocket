# PokemonPocket Assignment
Battle two Pokemons, with support for multiplayer.

Use PokemonPocket for the  client, PokemonServer for the server.
Server runs on port 5000 by default.

Note for multiplayer: Do NOT copy over DB and battle two pokemons with UUIDs
that are in the same pocket on either client! The result will be that the
opponent Pokemon with matching GUID will also suffer damage in the client's pocket.
